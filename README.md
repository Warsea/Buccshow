# Buccshow

The inspiration for this project came when Bucc first announced the skill showcasing during the semester break.
I was thinking about what I should create and wondering where we would have to submit the project once it's complete.
Then it occured to me that why don't I create a platform where Bucc members can easily submit their projects. Other's can view what projects different BUCC members have been working on. 
With that in mind, I created BuccShow. 
The project is build using python(Django) and Bootstrap.
